    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.periodictable.com" target="_blank">periodic table</a> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as <dfn>Fe</dfn> for iron, <dfn>H</dfn> for hydrogen, and <dfn>O</dfn> for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <em>chemical equations</em>. Here’s an example of a <em>chemical reaction</em>:</p>
    <p><var>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O</var></p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<dfn>H<sub>2</sub></dfn>) and oxygen gas (<dfn>O<sub>2</sub></dfn>) to form water (<dfn>H<sub>2</sub>O</dfn>).</p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Stoichiometry</strong> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
